# sinatra-routine-mvc

###About

Welcome to the Sinatra Routine MVC! Create, edit, and keep track of your routines, schedules, and tasks.

###Getting Started

To use this app, first clone this repository.

Run ```bundle install```, ```rake db:migrate```, and ```rake db:seed``` for initial set up.

Then, run shotgun and open your browser's localhost.

###Users, Routines, and Tasks

Once the app is up and running, and you have logged in or signed up, you can view your existing routines, or create a new one. Each routine has a schedule (i.e. Monday, Wednesday, Friday) and tasks (i.e. clean, study, exercise), and is visible only to the user who created the routine. Set up multiple routines, or just one, and edit or delete as you see fit. Log out to end your session.

Enjoy!
